# Esp-32-robot
this is the code and the stl files for my robot that can be controlled thru wifi. To controle it you have to connecto to the wifi "esp32" and put the password that is in the code then you have to search for the ip of the esp32 wich you can see in the serial monitor by pressing reset button and then its prety simple
